### Setting it up

To use the docker image just pull it from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiaguinho/nmrcraft_arch) and make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is installed. To pull it you can execute this command:

```bash
docker pull tiaguinho/nmrcraft_arch
```

Open the container either via console or in Vscode:

_Linux/MacOS_ console command:
```bash
docker run -it nmrcraft_arch
```

Windows powershell command:
```bash
docker.exe run -it nmrcraft_arch
```

<details>
<summary>Using Docker in VS Code</summary>
<ol>
<li> Open VS Code and install the extensions for Docker and Dev Containers.</li>
<li> Go to the newly added Docker Tab. Here you should now see three sections: Containers, Images and Registries. And under Images the tiaguinho/nmrcraft_arch image should be visible.</li>
<li> In order for the container not to be deleted every time you stop it we have to remove the --rm commad. For this go to the settings (Ctrl + , on Mac) and type `docker run`. Select 'Edit the settings.json' for the 'Run Interactive' command and remove the --rm to get: "docker.commands.runInteractive": "${containerCommand} run -it ${exposedPorts} ${tag}", "docker.commands.run": "${containerCommand} run -d ${exposedPorts} ${tag}". Save the file.</li>
<li> In the Docker Tab on the right, right click on the image and select run interactive. Now a conainer should appear in the Container section. Right click on it and select stop to start it back up.</li>
<li> Right click again on the container and select start to start it back up.</li>
<li> Right click again on the container and select attach Visual Studio Code. A new VS Code window should apear, this window is now fully in the container.</li>
<li> Have fun developing.</li>
</ol>
</details>

### Activate the Poetry venv

To use the packages installed via poetry you need to execute the following command:

```bash
poetry shell
```

This will put you into the poetry shell from where you have direct access to all packages managed by poetry.

### GitHub pushing auth

To authenticate the Docker comes with the github cli application. To login execute this command:

```bash
gh auth login
```

and follow the interactive instructions with enter and the arrow keys. Once logged in you should be able to push changes to the repo.

### Building a Docker Image and running it manually

To build a Docker image you can run the following commands on _Linux/MacOS_ to build and run an image:

```bash
docker buildx build -t $Image_Name .
```

or on Windows

```bash
docker.exe buildx build -t $Image_Name .
```

### Adding dependencies to the project

If you added a new feature that requires a new package/dependency, you can add it to the `pyproject.toml` file and run `make install` to install the new dependencies.

```bash
poetry add <package-name>
```

(You might need to run `poetry lock` to update the `poetry.lock` file if you added a dependency manually in the `pyproject.toml` file.)

### Loading the Data

The dataset is stored in a private repository on HuggingFace.

To download the dataset on the Hub in Python, you need to log in to your Hugging Face account:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

Access the dataset:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("NMRcraft/nmrcraft", data_files='all_no_nan.csv')
dataset['train'].to_pandas() # contains the data for now
```

Or download locally in just a few lines:

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
hf_hub_download(repo_id="NMRcraft/nmrcraft", filename="all_no_nan.csv", repo_type="dataset", local_dir="./data/")

```

The dataset is provided in its "raw" form as a dataframe in `all_no_nan.csv`, meaning without a train/test split or feature selection.
in the folder `./xyz.zip`, all optimized geometries are added as an .xtpopt.xyz file.
