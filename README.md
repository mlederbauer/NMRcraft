## Getting started with your project

First, create a repository on GitHub with the same name as this project, and then run the following commands:

```bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:mlederbauer/nmrcraft.git
git push -u origin main
```

Finally, install the environment and the pre-commit hooks with

```bash
make install
```

(You might need to run `pip install poetry` after creating a venv first.)

You are now ready to start development on your project!
The CI/CD pipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main, or when you create a new release.
